    <p>Humayun's Tomb is a stunning example of Mughal architecture located in Delhi, India. It was commissioned by Humayun's widow, Empress Bega Begum, in 1569-70. The tomb was designed by the Persian architect Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and is considered the first substantial example of Mughal architecture in India, laying the foundation for the Taj Mahal.</p>
    
    <p>The tomb is set within a large garden complex and features a striking combination of red sandstone and white marble. Its grand dome, set atop an octagonal base, is surrounded by lush gardens, reflecting pools, and several smaller tombs. The design of the tomb is notable for its symmetrical layout and the use of geometric patterns, which are characteristic of Mughal architectural style.</p>
    
    <p>The complex also includes several other notable structures, such as the Charbagh garden, which is divided into four quadrants, and the tombs of other members of the Mughal family. The gardens, with their raised pathways and water channels, create a serene and contemplative atmosphere, enhancing the monument's beauty.</p>
    
    <p>Humayun's Tomb was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993. The site has undergone extensive restoration work over the years to preserve its historical and architectural significance. It remains one of Delhi's most important historical landmarks and a must-visit destination for those interested in Mughal history and architecture.</p>
