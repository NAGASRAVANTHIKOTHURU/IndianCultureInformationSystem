        <h3>Music</h3>
        <div class="category-content">
            <p>Music in India holds a revered position, deeply intertwined with spirituality, cultural traditions, and artistic expressions. It encompasses a vast spectrum of genres, ranging from classical ragas to vibrant folk tunes and contemporary Bollywood hits. Indian classical music, rooted in ancient scriptures and traditions, is divided into two main traditions: Hindustani and Carnatic. Hindustani music, prevalent in North India, is characterized by its use of ragas (melodic frameworks) and talas (rhythmic cycles). It includes vocal and instrumental forms such as Khayal, Dhrupad, Thumri, and Tappa, each with its distinct style and emotive depth. Instruments like the sitar, tabla, sarangi, and flute are integral to Hindustani music, with maestros known for their improvisational skills and mastery over intricate rhythms and melodies. Carnatic music, predominant in South India, is known for its structured compositions, intricate ornamentation (gamakas), and rhythmic precision. It revolves around compositions (kritis) composed by legendary composers like Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar, and Syama Sastri. Instruments like the veena, mridangam, violin, and ghatam accompany Carnatic vocal performances, creating a harmonious blend of melody and rhythm.</p>

            <p>Painting in India is a rich tapestry woven with historical significance, cultural diversity, and artistic brilliance. The tradition of painting in India spans thousands of years, evolving through various periods and styles, each reflecting unique regional influences and thematic depth. Ancient Indian painting finds its roots in rock art found in caves such as Bhimbetka, dating back to prehistoric times.
