   <p>The Taj Mahal, meaning "Crown of the Palace", is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth. The Taj Mahal also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself, who was later buried there after his death in 1666.</p> 
 
<p>The construction of the Taj Mahal complex involved not only skilled artisans but also architects from across the Mughal Empire and beyond. The project employed around 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, the court architect of Emperor Shah Jahan. The intricate marble work, inlay designs, and garden layout reflect the pinnacle of Mughal architecture.</p> 
 
<p>Completed in its entirety in 1653, the Taj Mahal is estimated to have cost around 32 million rupees at the time, which today would equate to about US $1 billion. The mausoleum is renowned for its symmetrical beauty, intricate craftsmanship, and use of precious materials such as marble and semi-precious stones.</p> 
 
<p>The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, recognizing it as "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It stands as a symbol of enduring love and devotion, representing the cultural and historical significance of the Mughal Empire in India.</p> 
 
<p>Besides the main mausoleum, the Taj Mahal complex includes several other buildings and extensive gardens. The gardens, known as the Charbagh, are laid out in a formal Persian style with raised pathways, sunken flowerbeds, and a reflecting pool that mirrors the image of the mausoleum. Two grand structures made of red sandstone flank the main mausoleum: the mosque to the west and the guest house to the east.</p> 
 
<p>The calligraphy on the Taj Mahal's walls was created by the Persian calligrapher Amanat Khan and consists of verses from the Quran. The calligraphy, inlaid with black marble, is not only a testament to the artisans' skills but also adds a spiritual dimension to the monument.</p> 
 
<p>The Taj Mahal's changing hues at different times of the day are another fascinating aspect. The marble surfaces appear pinkish in the morning, milky white in the evening, and golden under the moonlight. This phenomenon is attributed to the reflective quality of the marble and the inlay work, making the Taj Mahal a dynamic piece of architecture.</p> 
 
<p>In recent years, efforts have been made to preserve the Taj Mahal and protect it from environmental pollution. Measures such as restricting vehicular traffic near the monument, using non-invasive cleaning techniques, and planting pollution-absorbing plants in the vicinity have been implemented to maintain its pristine condition.</p>
