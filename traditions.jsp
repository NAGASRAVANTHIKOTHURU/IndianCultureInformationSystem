            <div class="category-text">
                <p>Astrology in India holds deep cultural significance, influencing daily life, decisions, and festivities. Based on ancient Vedic principles, astrology guides individuals in various aspects of life, including marriage, career, and health. The twelve zodiac signs, or Rashis, each govern specific traits and behaviors, shaping personal and professional relationships. Birth charts, or Kundalis, are meticulously prepared by astrologers, detailing planetary positions at the time of birth and offering insights into one's destiny and character. Festivals like Makar Sankranti and Pongal are celebrated based on astrological calculations, marking auspicious transitions in the solar calendar. Jyotish Shastra, the science of light, encompasses predictive astrology and remedial measures to mitigate planetary influences. Astrology remains integral to Indian culture, guiding millions with its profound wisdom and spiritual insights.</p>
