    <p>Rashtrapati Bhavan, located in New Delhi, is the official residence of the President of India. Originally known as the Viceroy's House, it was designed by the British architect Edwin Lutyens and completed in 1929. The building is a remarkable example of British colonial architecture blended with Indian motifs and is situated at the western end of Rajpath, overlooking the expansive Raisina Hill.</p> 
    
    <p>The Rashtrapati Bhavan serves as a central administrative hub and is an iconic symbol of India's democracy. The building covers an area of approximately 320 acres, including beautiful gardens that are open to the public during specific times of the year. The Mughal Gardens, situated within the complex, are renowned for their aesthetic beauty and design, featuring terraced lawns, fountains, and floral arrangements.</p>
    
    <p>The architectural design of Rashtrapati Bhavan includes elements from traditional Indian architecture, such as the use of Indian motifs in the design of the dome and the columned verandahs. The central dome is inspired by the Buddhist Stupa, while the overall design reflects a harmonious blend of Indian and Western styles.</p>
    
    <p>The building's grand Durbar Hall, with its high dome and marble flooring, is used for state functions and official ceremonies. The Rashtrapati Bhavan also houses the President's residence, offices, and ceremonial spaces, including the Ashoka Hall and the Hall of Mirrors.</p>
    
    <p>Rashtrapati Bhavan is not just a residence but also a symbol of India's heritage and democracy, reflecting the nation's commitment to cultural and architectural excellence.</p>
