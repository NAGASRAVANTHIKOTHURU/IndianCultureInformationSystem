        <p>Vishu, celebrated predominantly in Kerala, marks the Malayalam New Year and is observed with deep cultural significance. The festival begins with the Vishukkani, where auspicious items like rice, fruits, vegetables, flowers, and coins are arranged in front of deities as the first sight on Vishu morning. This ritual symbolizes prosperity and good fortune for the coming year. Families wake up early to view the Vishukkani, believing it sets the tone for a prosperous year ahead. Traditional meals play a central role in Vishu celebrations, with special dishes like Vishu Kanji, Thoran, and Vishu Katta prepared and enjoyed together. Cultural performances, including traditional dances like Kaikottikali and songs, add to the festive spirit. Giving gifts, known as Vishu Kaineettam, to younger members of the family is a cherished tradition that signifies blessings and goodwill.</p>
