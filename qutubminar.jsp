    <p>Qutub Minar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the tallest brick minaret in the world, standing in Delhi, India. It was built by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the founder of the Delhi Sultanate, and completed by his successor Iltutmish. The construction of the minaret began in 1192 and was completed in 1220.</p> 
 
<p>Qutub Minar is made of red sandstone and marble and stands at a height of 73 meters (240 feet). The tower has five distinct stories, each marked by a projecting balcony. The lower three stories are made of red sandstone, while the upper two stories are made of marble and sandstone.</p> 
 
<p>The complex surrounding Qutub Minar also includes the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, which was built using the materials from demolished Hindu and Jain temples. The iron pillar in the courtyard of the mosque is notable for its rust-resistant composition and remains a marvel of ancient metallurgy.</p> 
 
<p>Qutub Minar is an outstanding example of early Indo-Islamic architecture and has influenced the construction of other minarets in India. It attracts visitors from around the world, fascinated by its historical significance and architectural grandeur.</p> 
 
<p>The minaret is adorned with intricate carvings and inscriptions in Arabic, which are verses from the Quran and details of the minaret's history. The base of the Qutub Minar has a diameter of 14.3 meters (47 feet), which tapers to 2.7 meters (9 feet) at the top. Each story of the minaret is characterized by a different architectural style, showcasing the evolution of design during the period of its construction.</p> 
 
<p>Adjacent to the Qutub Minar is the Alai Darwaza, a magnificent gateway built by Alauddin Khalji in 1311. This gateway is renowned for its elaborate decoration and serves as a fine example of the integration of Islamic and Hindu architectural elements.</p> 
 
<p>The Qutub Minar complex also houses the Alai Minar, an incomplete tower that was intended to be twice the height of Qutub Minar. Construction of the Alai Minar was abandoned after the death of Alauddin Khalji, leaving only a massive, truncated structure that stands as a testament to the ambitious architectural projects of the time.</p> 
 
<p>The lush gardens surrounding the Qutub Minar provide a tranquil setting for visitors to explore the historical site. The complex is not only a symbol of India's rich cultural heritage but also a testament to the architectural and engineering prowess of the medieval period.</p> 
 
<p>In recent years, conservation efforts have been undertaken to preserve the Qutub Minar and its surrounding structures. These efforts include restoring the minaret's stonework, maintaining the lush gardens, and implementing measures to protect the site from environmental damage and the effects of urbanization.</p>
